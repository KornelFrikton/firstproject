            <h3>"You have to dig in to get the win", said the coach</h3>
                <p>After the match against Levante, <strong>Zinadine Zidane</strong> spoke in the press room and said: </p>
                <p><q>We started the first half very well and the first 10 or 15 minutes of the second. We had two or three chances in the second half. We wanted press high up and two or three times they came out of that pressure. We have to be proud and happy with what the boys did.</q></p> 
                <p><q>We have just started LaLiga and we’ve played four games, and have three wins and a draw. I would have liked to have got the second one in the first half or in the first fifteen minutes of the second half. If you score, you change the match.</q></p>
                <p>About the opponents:</p>
                <p><q>You come up against different opponents and they can be in good form; that’s football. In the end we didn’t have it all our own way and at times you have to dig in to win. They had good moments, with two or three chances in the second half and that's normal in a match.</q></p>
                <p>He mentioned <strong>Vinicius</strong> also:</p>
                <p><q>He's scored today. What more can I ask from him? He's trying to work hard and improve. We have to be happy. I'm not going to talk about a mistake, but about the positives and his goal, which was a nice one.</q></p>

            <h3 id="levreal">Levante - Real Madrid : 0-2</h3>
                <p><strong>Vinicius Jr</strong> and <strong>Benzema</strong>'s goals goals were enough to beat Levante, the third consecutive win for Zidane's team. It is the third victory in a row, as LaLiga goes in to the international break,
                    <strong>Vinicius Jr</strong> netting in the second game in a row.</p>
                <p>After just quarter of an hour of play, the scene was set. <strong>Modric</strong> took a corner and Vezo's clearance was met by <strong>Vinicius</strong> , who brought it down inside the area before striking the ball beautifully past Aitor who could do nothing to keep it out. <strong> (0 - 1) </strong> <em> Vinicius Jr. 16' </em></p>

            </div>    
            <p>Levante reacted and came close to equalising in the 30th minute. Another set piece saw Campaña whip in the corner and Vukcevic's header struck <strong>Courtois</strong>' bar.</p>
            <p>This was the start of the visitors' dominance after the break as <strong>Modric</strong> picked up the ball on the edge of the area after a clearance from Vezo in the 51st minute, playing it in to <strong>Benzema</strong> but the Frenchman's shot hit the post. A minute later Asensio picked up <strong>Vinicius</strong>s run between the lines and the Brazilian shot across goal.</p>
            <p>Levante reacted well and could have levelled through two Bardhi strikes from the edge of the box, but <strong>Courtois</strong> was equal to it. The game became an end-to-end affair and the chances began to flow. <strong>Ramos</strong> had the ball in the net, heading home a <strong>Modric</strong>' corner on 68’, but the goal was ruled out for off-side following a VAR review.</p>
            <p>From that point to the end, Levante attacked with greater sharpness and the LaLiga leaders were forced to display all their defensive solidity. Then, in injury time, <strong>Rodrygo</strong> led a swift counter-attack and found <strong>Benzema</strong>, who made no mistake when through against Aitor. It was his <strong>250.</strong> goal in Real Madrid! <strong> (0 - 2) </strong> <em> Benzema 95' </em></p>
